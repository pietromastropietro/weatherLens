## About

A simple and straightforward weather forecast app built with Javascript, React and Sass.
Other libraries also used are [axios](https://axios-http.com/) for HTTP requests and [date-fns](https://date-fns.org/) to simplify date formatting.

Users can search for any city in the World, and get all weather info needed, such as: 

- Current conditions
- Current day's wind, rain, and temperature averages
- Hourly forecast up to 48 hours with temperature, wind speed and rain quantity
- Weekly projection with forecast and highs and lows

Users can also choose between light and dark theme, and switch from metric system (celsius degrees, km/h) to imperial (fahrenheit, mp/h).
